    "Below I attempted an exercise to learn about and practice web scraping. I haven't had any previous experience with web scraping, so this is very much a learning exercise! I wanted to create a small dataframe with the top books from a section of the [New York Time's best sellers list](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/). The main page shows the top 5 books broken down into different categories based on book type and format (hardcover, paperback, e-book), so I thought it would be more interesting to focus in on the [Combined Print & E-Book Fiction](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/combined-print-and-e-book-fiction/) page, which lists the top 15 books, to make things more interesting. In hindsight, I probably would have had an easier time if I chose the Hardcover Fiction category, as I found that most of the inconsistencies I had to work around were based on a few e-books that were listed.

    "Because I wanted to bring in additional information for each book, I made an additional request for each book to get the html for the Amazon page linked for each book. This slowed down the run time significantly, but did allow me to bring in extra information such as the number of pages, language, publication date, and ISBNs for most of the books. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I was iterating through the information on the Amazon page for each book, I was hoping to use the section near the top that listed the above additional information. At first I thought that length, language, publisher, publication date were alwayas the first 4 items listed, and then it varied with between ISBNs if it was a hardcover or paperbook book and having file size and other information for ebooks. But I found even if I accounted for ebooks here and skipped ISBNs, the first four pieces weren't always the same. So while I had originally hoped to iterate through the first four objects, I opted to instead compare each item with if statements to see what they were. Otherwise I would end up with '5 Years and Up' recommended reading age for George R.R. Martin's Fire & Blood in Pages column! \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly I ran into issues with one book not listing the publisher in that section of the website. This gave me errors with my list of Publishers being shorter than the other lists when I tried to make my dataframe. As such I put in a workaround to add a null value there if that happened. Once I added this section to put in a null value if one wasn't found, I decided to add in grabbing the ISBNs for all the non e-books listed, passing in a null value if they weren't found for the e-books."
